1 REM CALCULATOR-1.2, Nik Mallett. Playing with GOSUB.

3 REM Make sure we go to the "main" routine:
4 GOTO 30

5 REM Basic cleanup:
6 NORMAL
7 CLEAR
8 HOME
9 RETURN

10 REM Basic input subroutine:
11 PRINT "ENTER FIRST INTEGER: "
12 INVERSE
13 INPUT X
14 NORMAL
15 PRINT "ENTER SECOND INTEGER: "
16 INVERSE
17 INPUT Y
18 NORMAL
19 RETURN

20 REM Calculation subroutine:
21 PRINT "RESULT OF ADDING "X" AND "Y" IS " X + Y
22 PRINT "RESULT OF SUBTRACTING "X" FROM "Y" IS " Y - X
23 PRINT "RESULT OF SUBTRACTING "Y" FROM "X" IS " X - Y
24 PRINT "RESULT OF MULTIPLYING "X" BY "Y" IS " X * Y
25 PRINT "RESULT OF DIVIDING "X" BY "Y" IS " X/Y
26 PRINT "RESULT OF DIVIDING "Y" BY "X" IS " Y/X
27 RETURN

30 REM Now for the actual program part:
31 GOSUB 5
32 GOSUB 11
33 GOSUB 20
34 END
